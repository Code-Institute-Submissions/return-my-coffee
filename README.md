# Return myCoffee

[View live project here](https://ellenst264.github.io/return-my-coffee/)

This web-application is a fun, interactive game that combines popular mini-games together into one immersive experience. In Return myCoffee users must complete each mini-game in order to retrieve a cup of coffee that has been stolen from them!

## Project Purpose 

Return myCoffee is aimed at a target audience of all ages, who want to play a fun and simple browser game on their computer or on their tablet or mobile device. The aim of the application is to provide a fun and easy experience for users. It gives users a new way of playing popular mini-games by linking each game in a fun narrative, which allows the audience to immerse themselves into the game in an interactive, intuitive way.

### Project Goals

The most significant goal of this project is to ensure that the game is entertaining and easy to play. No downloads are necessary to play the game and it can be enjoyed on any device, making it easily accessible. This project strives to offer something new by presenting familiar mini-games to users in an unqiue and immersive way.

### Project Owner Goals

The primary goal is to create something unique - presenting a browser game that is responsive and enjoyable.

### Target Audience 

The target audience is open to anyone who is fond of playing quick fun mini-games such as the *memory card game*, *whack-a-mole* and *frogger*. However, there are subtle references to coding that an astute eye may pick up on - the most obvious one can be found in the game title name.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

### First Time Visitor Goals

- As a first time visitor I want to immediately understand the purpose of the application.

- As a first time visitor I want to play an interactive browser based game that is easy to use, fun and intuitive.

- I want the game to have a challenge in terms of a timelimit or a score I need to beat.

- I want to be able to change the difficulty of the game.

- I want to be able to play the game on any device.

- I want the game instructions to be clear.

- I want the game's user interface to be pleasant.


### Returning Vistor Goals

- As a returning visitor I want to try and beat my high score, which means I expect a local storage system which will save my score for the game.

- As I have played the game before, I now seek a bigger challenge, so I want to be able to change the difficulty of the game.

## Design 

### Typography 

I have imported the following fonts from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) library to use in my project:

- [Source Code pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro?query=code)

- [Nanum Gothic Coding](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nanum+Gothic?query=nan)

- [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata?query=incon)

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

- [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?query=robot)

Source Code Pro, Nanum Gothic Coding, Inconsolata and Roboto Mono have Monospace as a fallback font in case the fonts fail. 

Roboto has a fallback font of Sans Serif incase it fails to import.

All of the fonts have a similar style, but their subtle differences help add visual variety to the project to make it more interesting. I chose this style of font to stress the project's purpose. The fonts can easily be associated with arcade games, older RPG games and/or text-based games. Examples of this are displayed below:

| Example 1 | Example 2 | Example 3 |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| ![Game font example screenshot 1](assets/img/main/font-example1.png) | ![Game font example screenshot 2](assets/img/main/font-example2.png) | ![Game font example screenshot 3](assets/img/main/font-example3.png) |


It was important to ensure that I chose a typography style that was clear, readable and consistent. I believe each page achieves this and promotes the project theme effectively.

Each page uses the following fonts:

- Hompage 
    - Source Code Pro
    - Nanum Gothic Coding
    - Inconsolata
    - Roboto Mono

- Memory Game 
    - Source Code Pro

- Whack-A-Mole
    - Roboto 

- Frogger
    - Roboto

- Roboto was used for the game user interface in Whack-A-Mole and Frogger.

  - Roboto is more readble than the other fonts when against a visually packed background. When the screen size becomes smaller, it is increasingly easier to read than the former fonts. This is why Roboto was used for both Whack-A-Mole and Frogger - to ensure that users could see the user interface clearly. 


### Colour Scheme

In the initial design phase I opted to try out a 'coffee' colour scheme for the Homepage, which can be seen [here](assets/wireframes/homepage-old.png). However when the time came to write the code and I had the design properly laid out on the browser, the design choice didn't seem right. So I went back to the surface plane and redesigned the layout and colour scheme entirely.

|  |  |
| --------- | --------- |
| ![Color pyschology](assets/img/main/color-psychology1.png) | ![Color pyschology](assets/img/main/color-psychology2.png) |

I wanted the project to be vibrant, colourful and eye-catching, and it was imperative for the design to envoke a positive emotional response from the user.

The primary colour scheme for the **Homepage** is blue, green and yellow. 

- Blue is trustworthy and peaceful colour. It is a friendly colour, which makes the application more approachable and incites relaxtion. This ties in nicely with the application's purpose as people often play games to unwind.

- Green is a calming, reassuring colour. It is heavily associated with nature which links with the project's visual imagery in regards to the background images that are used. It is also associated with moving forward, like green in a traffic light, which can incite users to play the game.

- Yellow is a cheerful, optimistic colour, which is associated with the outdoors. Like green, this alludes to the project's visual theme. Yellow can also link to the colour of coffee!

- Blue green and yellow all combine nicely to create the atmosphere of being outdoors. This is where I would like to imagine that the game narrative is set, which is implied with textual content, background images and colours.

### Wireframes 

I prepared all my wireframes in [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html). Adobe XD allowed me to experiment with the appliation's design before creating any of the code and helped with the construction of the surface plane. After writing the code, however, some design choices were altered, and I even went back to Adobe XD to recreate the design for the homepage. All of these design stages can be accessed below.

Each page has a wireframe for both desktop and mobile devices. I did not include a tablet wireframe in the design phase because there is no stark differences between tablet and desktop (for larger tablet devices) or tablet and mobile for smaller tablet devices. Additionally, many laptops also have touchscreen functionality, making the similarity even greater.

The only difference between tablet and desktop is the collapsible navbar with the hamburger icon. This alteration is represented in the mobile wireframe.

2. Locate the project's GitHub **repository**.
3. At the top of the project's repository (not the top of the screen) select the **'Setting'** button from the menu.
4. On the Settings, scroll down the default page until you locate the **'GitHub Pages'** section (near the bottom of the page). 
5. Under **'Source'**, click the **dropdown-menu** called 'None' and in **'select branch' choose 'master'**.)
6. Click **Save** to confirm your selection. The page will automatically refresh.
7. Scroll back down to 'GitHub Pages' and you will see a link to your deployed site.
8. You're done!

### Make a Local Clone

1. **Sign in** to your **GitHub** and locate the project's GitHub **repository**.
2. Under the repository name, click the **green 'Clone' button**.
3. To clone the repository using **HTTPS**, make sure the **HTTPS** is clicked (it will be underlined in orange) and **copy the link** provided.
4. Open **Git Bash**
5. Change your current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be.
6. In the **terminal** type `git clone` and **paste the URL** you copied in step 3.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```
7. Press **Enter** - your local clone is created.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
